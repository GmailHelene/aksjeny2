# Watchlist, Sentiment & Technical Analysis Fixes Report

## Summary
This update consolidates duplicate sentiment routes, aligns the frontend watchlist addition logic with the canonical backend API, introduces robust symbol sanitization, and improves technical analysis error handling—reducing risk of 500 errors and improving user clarity.

## Changes Implemented

1. Removed Duplicate Sentiment Route
   - Deleted lightweight `/analysis/sentiment` placeholder in `analysis_clean.py`.
   - Ensures only the robust implementation in `analysis.py` serves the endpoint, preventing template key mismatches and intermittent 500s.

2. Watchlist Add Endpoint Alignment
   - Updated `app/static/js/watchlist-fix.js` to call `/api/watchlist/add` instead of `/watchlist/add`.
   - Standardized CSRF header to `X-CSRFToken` (previous variant used `X-CSRF-Token`).
   - Added resilient CSRF token resolution (meta tag, window.csrfToken, hidden input fallback).
   - Improved UI state transitions and accessibility (aria attributes, graceful error recovery).

3. Symbol Sanitization Utility
   - Added `app/utils/symbol_utils.py` with `sanitize_symbol()` enforcing:
     - Uppercasing, trimming, replacing legacy separators.
     - Allowed chars: A–Z, 0–9, dot, dash.
     - Max length 15.
     - Returns `(clean_symbol, is_valid_original)`.
   - Integrated into `analysis_clean.py` technical route and `analysis.py` technical route.

4. Technical Route Enhancements (`analysis.py` & `analysis_clean.py`)
   - Added invalid symbol early rejection with user-facing message.
   - Preserved existing real-data vs synthetic fallback logic.
   - Normalized error message semantics (Norwegian phrasing consistent).

5. Frontend Resilience
   - Watchlist JS now uses server-returned `item_count` when present; otherwise optimistic increment.
   - Achievement stat update made non-blocking with console debug fallback.

## Testing
- Partial suite: `pytest -k "analysis or technical or watchlist"` → 3 passed.
- Full suite: 69 passed, 8 skipped, 29 deselected (consistent with previous stabilized baseline). No new failures introduced.

## Security & Robustness Improvements
- Eliminated route collision risk for sentiment.
- Reduced reliance on CSRF exemptions for future hardening (frontend now always sends token header consistently).
- Input validation reduces potential malformed queries and undefined fallback states.

## Files Affected
- Modified: `app/static/js/watchlist-fix.js`
- Modified: `app/routes/analysis_clean.py`
- Modified: `app/routes/analysis.py`
- Added: `app/utils/symbol_utils.py`
- Added: `WATCHLIST_SENTIMENT_TECHNICAL_FIXES_REPORT.md`

## Follow-Up Recommendations
- Remove `@csrf.exempt` from watchlist API endpoints after confirming all templates inject CSRF meta tag universally.
- Apply `sanitize_symbol` to sentiment route and any portfolio/alerts endpoints accepting tickers.
- Introduce rate limiting or caching for high-frequency technical requests.
- Add unit tests specifically for `sanitize_symbol` and invalid symbol technical route responses.
- Unify multiple watchlist-related blueprints/endpoints (consider deprecating older duplicates for clarity).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] No duplicate `/analysis/sentiment` route remains.
- [x] Watchlist add frontend points to `/api/watchlist/add`.
- [x] CSRF header naming standardized.
- [x] Symbol sanitization integrated in technical routes.
- [x] Tests pass without new failures.
