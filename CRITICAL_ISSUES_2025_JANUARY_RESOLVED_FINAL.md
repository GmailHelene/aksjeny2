- Correct Warren Buffett route handling: `/analysis/warren-buffett?ticker=`

**Files Verified**:
- `app/templates/analysis/_menu.html` (lines 151-217)

### 6. ✅ Navigation Pages Show Real Data for Logged-in Users
**Problem**: Verification needed that navigation pages display real data for authenticated users
**Solution**: Verified proper authentication decorator usage
**Investigation Results**:
- Main navigation and stock pages use `@demo_access` - allows both demo and logged-in users to see real data
- User-specific features use `@login_required` - properly secured for authenticated users only
- Analysis routes use `@demo_access` or `@access_required` - ensures universal access to analysis features
- Data visibility properly configured across all navigation endpoints

**Files Verified**:
- `app/routes/stocks.py` - All major stock routes use `@demo_access`
- `app/routes/analysis.py` - Analysis routes properly configured
- `app/routes/main.py` - Navigation routes properly secured
- Authentication system working correctly for data access

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
