# Profile Route Fix Report - 2025-09-08 13:59:03

## Issue Summary
The profile page at https://aksjeradar.trade/profile was not working correctly. 
Users received a "Det oppstod en teknisk feil under lasting av profilen" error message
and were being redirected to https://aksjeradar.trade/stocks/list/index.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the issue, we found that:

1. The main profile route in `app/routes/main.py` was attempting to redirect to 'profile.profile_page'
2. The profile blueprint was registered with a URL prefix of '/profile'
3. The profile_page route in the profile blueprint was defined at '/'
4. This created a routing conflict where /profile would try to redirect to /profile/ but the redirect wasn't working properly

## Fix Implemented
We implemented the following fix:

1. Updated the main profile route in `app/routes/main.py` to directly handle the profile page rendering
   instead of redirecting to the profile blueprint.
2. The route now properly loads user favorites and statistics and renders the profile.html template.
3. Added proper error handling to show informative error messages if something goes wrong.

## Files Modified
- `app/routes/main.py` - Updated the profile route implementation

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- The profile page now loads correctly at https://aksjeradar.trade/profile
- User favorites and statistics are displayed properly
- Error handling is in place to gracefully handle any issues

## Additional Information
This fix ensures that users can access their profile page directly without being redirected
to another route that might fail. The implementation is now more straightforward and 
less prone to routing conflicts.
