# Fixed Flask App Deployment Guide

## Understanding The Problem

Your Flask application was encountering this error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app_init'
```

This happens because of:

1. The attempt to use `importlib` didn't work because it changes the module name
2. The original circular import issue still exists when running on the server

## Simple Solution

The simplest solution is to **rename `app.py`** to avoid the naming conflict with the `app` package folder.

## How To Deploy

I've created deployment scripts that handle the renaming automatically:

1. For Windows:
   ```
   deploy_fixed_circular_import.bat
   ```

2. For Linux/Mac:
   ```
   chmod +x deploy_fixed_circular_import.sh
   ./deploy_fixed_circular_import.sh
   ```

These scripts:
1. Back up your original app.py
2. Rename app.py to avoid the conflict
3. Set the right environment variables
4. Deploy to Railway

## What Changes Were Made

1. Created a new file called `application.py` with the same functionality as `app.py`
2. Updated `main.py` and `wsgi.py` to use a simpler import pattern
3. Added deployment scripts that rename `app.py` during deployment

## Important Notes

- After deployment, you should keep using `application.py` as your main entry point
- The deployment scripts temporarily rename `app.py` so you can still edit it locally
- This solution is better than the previous fix attempt because it's more direct and reliable

## If Problems Persist

If you still see circular import errors:

1. Manually rename `app.py` to something like `aksjeny2_app.py`
2. Update `Procfile` or other deployment files to point to the new file name
3. Make sure `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set correctly
