# Norwegian Intel Shipping Intelligence Icon Fix - Complete

## âœ… Issue Resolution Summary

**Original Problem:** 
The user reported that on the Norwegian Intel page (https://aksjeradar.trade/norwegian-intel/), the Shipping Intelligence card displayed a gray circle instead of an icon.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The template was using FontAwesome icon class `fas fa-ship` while the rest of the application uses Bootstrap Icons. This inconsistency caused the icon to display as a gray circle because FontAwesome wasn't properly loaded or configured for this specific icon.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed the icon class from `fas fa-ship` (FontAwesome) to `bi bi-globe2` (Bootstrap Icons)
- This maintains consistency with all other cards in the Norwegian Intel dashboard
- The globe icon is semantically appropriate for shipping intelligence/global maritime data

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

**File Modified:** 
`app/templates/norwegian_intel/index.html`

**Change Made:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<i class="fas fa-ship text-success" style="font-size: 3rem;"></i>

<!-- AFTER -->
<i class="bi bi-globe2 text-success" style="font-size: 3rem;"></i>
```

**Icon Library Consistency:**
- âœ… Social Sentiment: `bi bi-chat-square-heart` (Bootstrap Icons)
- âœ… Oljekorrelasjoner: `bi bi-fuel-pump` (Bootstrap Icons)  
- âœ… RegjeringspÃ¥virkning: `bi bi-building` (Bootstrap Icons)
- âœ… Shipping Intelligence: `bi bi-globe2` (Bootstrap Icons) **FIXED**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome

The Shipping Intelligence card on the Norwegian Intel page should now display:
- A proper globe icon instead of a gray circle
