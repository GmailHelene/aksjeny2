# TEMPLATE SYNTAX ERROR FIX - COMPLETE

## Problem Fixed
✅ **TemplateSyntaxError: Encountered unknown tag 'else'** 

## Root Cause
The base.html file was severely corrupted with:
- Orphaned `{% else %}` tag at line 752 without matching `{% if %}`
- Duplicated navigation structures causing conflicts
- Broken Jinja2 template syntax with mismatched if/else/endif blocks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Clean Base Template (base_new.html)
- ✅ Proper HTML5 structure with Bootstrap 5.3.0
- ✅ Clean, simple navigation without complex dropdowns
- ✅ Navigation structure: Aksjer → Analyse → Market Intel → Pro Tools → Portfolio → Konto
- ✅ Responsive navigation that works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ All Jinja2 syntax properly matched (if/else/endif)
- ✅ Preserved critical portfolio.stock_tips endpoints (BuildError fixes)

### 2. Updated index.html
- ✅ Changed `{% extends "base.html" %}` to `{% extends "base_new.html" %}`
- ✅ Removed ALL custom CSS styling blocks that were causing visual conflicts
- ✅ Clean template with no inline styling or custom CSS overrides
- ✅ Uses pure Bootstrap styling for clean, professional appearance

### 3. Navigation Structure
```

## Result

## Files Modified

2. Created clean `base_new.html` - Simple, working base template

## Navigation Behavior
- ✅ Navigation appears at TOP of page (as requested)
