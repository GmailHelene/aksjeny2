# Fixed Circular Import Solution

## The Problem

Your Flask application was encountering this error during startup:

```
ERROR during Flask app startup: cannot import name 'app' from 'app' (/app/app/__init__.py)
```

This happens because:

1. You have a file named `app.py` in your project root
2. You also have a package directory named `app/` with an `__init__.py` file
3. Python's import system gets confused between these two items with the same name

## The Solution

I've created a completely new approach to solve this issue:

1. Created a new startup script (`start_fixed.py`) that:
   - Properly sets up the Python path
   - Loads necessary modules before importing your app
   - Uses a special import technique to avoid the circular reference

2. Updated your deployment configurations:
   - Modified `railway.toml` to use the new startup script
   - Updated `Dockerfile` to use the new startup script
   - Updated `Procfile` to use the new startup script

3. Created deployment scripts:
   - `deploy_fix.bat` (Windows)
   - `deploy_fix.sh` (Linux/Mac)

## How to Deploy

1. Make sure the changes are saved
2. Run the appropriate deployment script:
   - Windows: `deploy_fix.bat`
   - Linux/Mac: First run `chmod +x deploy_fix.sh` then `./deploy_fix.sh`

The script will:
1. Validate that the fix works
2. Deploy to Railway

## Why This Works

The new solution:
1. Uses Python's import system properly
2. Loads critical modules before attempting to import your app
3. Manipulates the system path to avoid conflicts
4. Uses the full package path to avoid ambiguity

## If You Still Have Issues

If you continue to have issues, consider:

1. Renaming the `app.py` file to something else like `flask_app.py`
2. Making sure your directory structure is clean
3. Checking that all import statements in your codebase are correct

## Long-Term Solution

For a more permanent solution, consider restructuring your application to avoid naming conflicts:

1. Rename `app.py` to something like `server.py` or `flask_server.py`
2. Consider renaming your `app` package to a more specific name like `aksjeny2_app`
