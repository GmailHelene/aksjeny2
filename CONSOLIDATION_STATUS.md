# Stock Details Template Consolidation Status

Unification complete. The `details.html` template has been fully rewritten to a clean version relying solely on external `stock-details.js` for dynamic behavior. All legacy inline JS and duplicate `{% block scripts %}` sections removed.

Next steps (optional):
- Remove obsolete `details_enhanced.html` and `details_clean.html` after validation.
- Verify runtime in browser: watchlist toggle, TradingView widget load, RSI/MACD charts.
- Add pytest view test to ensure route 200s and key IDs present.
