# Circular Import Fix

## Problem Solved

This fix addresses the Flask app startup error:

```
ERROR during Flask app startup: cannot import name 'app' from 'app' (/app/app/__init__.py)
```

## What Caused the Issue

The issue was a circular import problem that occurred because:

1. The main application file is named `app.py`
2. There's also a package directory named `app/` with an `__init__.py` file
3. When Python tries to import `create_app` from the `app` module, it gets confused between the file and the package

## The Solution

We fixed this by:

1. Using Python's `importlib` to directly import the `__init__.py` file without relying on package resolution
2. This avoids the circular import by bypassing the normal Python import system
3. The fix has been applied to `app.py`, `wsgi.py`, and `main.py`

## How to Deploy

1. Use one of the provided scripts:
   - Windows: `deploy_fixed_app.bat`
   - Linux/Mac: `deploy_fixed_app.sh` (run `chmod +x deploy_fixed_app.sh` first)

2. Or manually deploy to Railway:
   ```
   railway up
   ```

## If You Still Have Issues

If you still encounter deployment issues, try:

1. Renaming `app.py` to something like `application.py` to completely avoid the name conflict
2. Checking your Docker setup to ensure proper path configuration
3. Verifying the Railway deployment settings
