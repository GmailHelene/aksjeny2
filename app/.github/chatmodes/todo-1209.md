Initial Triage (High-Level)
High severity (user-facing errors / 500 / broken core flows):

Sentiment analysis 500 (/analysis/sentiment?symbol=DNB.OL)
Technical analysis symbol search not working (/analysis/technical?symbol=MSFT)
Price alerts creation failing (/price-alerts/create)
Watchlist add reports success but doesn’t display
Favorites removal security issue (CSRF exempt)
Method Not Allowed on profile referrals/invite
Insider trading search with undefined params
Mobile trading page error
Screener heart (favorites) not functioning
TradingView search broken
Stock details duplication + RSI/MACD conditional
Sector analysis duplicates / fallback
Medium severity (UX / accessibility / correctness but not outright failure):

Button contrast audit (remaining blue buttons)
External analyst coverage ordering and empty-state messages
Prediction page bottom section linking
Remove extra insider trading “Hot Stocks / Signals / Alerts / Premium” sections
Recommendations fallback messaging for AAPL
Canonical + Railway redirect
Correlation/request ID logging
Translation toggle
Rate limiting + input length guard for compare/screener inputs
Portfolio add/create duplication & CSRF
Settings toggle state reflection
Legacy recommendation templates cleanup
Low severity / structural hygiene:

Deduplicate sector analysis route (if not already covered)
Remove legacy templates
Correlation IDs
Refactor large harness later
Proposed Execution Order (First Batch)
Sentiment 500 (fast win: wrap data fetch, normalize ticker like DNB.OL)
Technical analysis symbol search failing (check param handling & frontend JS)
Undefined param sanitization gaps (central fix benefits insider & others)
Price alerts POST create failure (inspect route & form -> improve messaging)
Watchlist add flow (JS + backend endpoint alignment)
Favorites removal CSRF (replace exempt with token header)
Insider trading page cleanup (remove non-data sections + search normalization)
Stock details template duplication + RSI/MACD hide logic
Screener heart favorites integration
TradingView search fix Then regroup and report.
