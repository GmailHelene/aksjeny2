# Aksjeradar Application Testing Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from extensive testing of the Aksjeradar application. The tests were conducted on July 13, 2025, and focused on the following areas:

1. URL and endpoint validation
2. Authentication system (login, registration, password reset)
3. Subscription and payment flows
4. General functionality (portfolio, watchlist, analysis)

## Summary of Findings

The application appears to be partially functional, with several critical issues that need to be addressed before deployment.

### Connection Issues

**Observation**: The test scripts were able to connect to the base URL (`http://localhost:5000`) but many endpoints returned connection errors or 404 responses.

**Possible Causes**:
- The application may not be running properly on the expected port
- The server might be in a different environment than expected
- Some routes may not be properly implemented or registered

### Authentication System Issues

**Observation**: The authentication system (login, registration, password reset) is not functioning as expected.

**Key Issues**:
- CSRF token extraction failed, indicating that forms may not include proper CSRF protection
- Registration form was not found or not properly structured
- Login functionality could not be verified
- Password reset endpoints were not accessible

### Subscription and Payment Issues

**Observation**: The subscription and payment functionality shows partial implementation.

**Key Issues**:
- Pricing page exists but lacks expected content
- Subscription page is not accessible
- Stripe integration could not be verified
- Payment flows could not be tested

### Core Feature Issues

**Observation**: Many core features of the application are not accessible or functioning properly.

**Key Issues**:
- Portfolio functionality could not be accessed
- Watchlist functionality could not be accessed
- AI analysis pages (Graham, Buffett) were not accessible
- API endpoints for stock data, market data, and news were not available

## Prioritized Action Items

Based on the test results, here are the prioritized issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Server Configuration and Route Registration

**Action**: Verify that the application server is running correctly and all routes are properly registered.

**Steps**:
1. Check that the Flask application is running on the expected port
2. Review blueprint registration in the application factory
3. Validate route definitions in all blueprint files
4. Test basic routes manually to confirm accessibility

### 2. Authentication System Repair

**Action**: Fix the core authentication system to ensure users can register, login, and manage their accounts.

**Steps**:
1. Verify CSRF token implementation and form structure
2. Check login form and route handlers
3. Test registration functionality
4. Implement or fix password reset functionality

### 3. Subscription and Payment Integration

**Action**: Ensure the subscription system and Stripe integration are working properly.

**Steps**:
1. Fix pricing page content and CTAs
2. Ensure subscription page is accessible and properly configured
3. Verify Stripe checkout integration
4. Test the entire payment flow in a test/sandbox environment

### 4. Core Feature Implementation

**Action**: Ensure all core features are properly implemented and accessible.

**Steps**:
1. Fix portfolio functionality
2. Fix watchlist functionality
3. Implement or repair AI analysis features
4. Ensure API endpoints are properly configured and returning expected data

## Technical Recommendations

Based on the test results, here are technical recommendations to improve the application:

1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure consistent environment variables and configuration across development and production.

2. **Blueprint Organization**: Review and organize blueprints to ensure all routes are properly registered.

3. **CSRF Protection**: Implement consistent CSRF protection across all forms in the application.

4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling to provide more useful feedback when issues occur.

5. **Logging**: Enhance logging to capture more details about application errors.

6. **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests as part of the development workflow.

## Next Steps

1. Address the server configuration and route registration issues first
2. Fix the authentication system
3. Repair subscription and payment flows
4. Implement remaining core features
5. Conduct another round of comprehensive testing

## Conclusion

The Aksjeradar application requires significant attention to several critical areas before it can be considered production-ready. The issues identified in this report should be addressed systematically, with priority given to the core functionality (server configuration, authentication, and subscription system) before moving on to feature implementation.

After the initial fixes, another round of comprehensive testing should be conducted to ensure all issues have been resolved and the application is functioning as expected.
