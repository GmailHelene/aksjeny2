# Portfolio Route Fix Report

## Issue
The portfolio page at https://aksjeradar.trade/portfolio/ was not loading correctly. Users were receiving a 500 technical error with the message "Det oppstod en feil ved lasting av portef√∏ljer."

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Error Handling**: The original error handling in the portfolio overview route wasn't comprehensive enough to catch and properly handle certain exceptions that could occur during:
   - Stock data retrieval from external services
   - Price calculations with invalid or zero values
   - Database queries for portfolio stocks

2. **Logging**: Limited logging made it difficult to identify where issues were occurring

3. **Data Validation**: Insufficient validation for price data was causing errors during calculations when external APIs returned unexpected results

## Solution
The fix involved a complete overhaul of the portfolio overview route to provide:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Multiple layers of try/except blocks to isolate failures to specific stocks rather than the entire page
   - Comprehensive exception handling for each step of the data processing
   - Better fallbacks when data is unavailable or invalid

2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Detailed logging at each stage of the portfolio loading process
   - Specific logging for each stock being processed
   - Full stack traces for critical errors
   - Log levels appropriate to the severity of issues

3. **Robust Data Validation**:
   - Validation of price data to ensure it's numeric and positive
   - Handling of zero values to prevent division by zero errors
   - Safety checks before performing calculations
   - Fallback mechanisms when values are missing or invalid

4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Allow partial success - if one stock fails, the rest of the portfolio still displays
   - Provide meaningful feedback instead of complete failure

## Implementation
The implementation includes:

1. **Layered Error Handling**:
   - Catch-all protection for the entire route
   - Per-stock error handling
   - Per-calculation error protection

2. **Data Validation Checks**:
   - Validating both current and purchase prices
   - Ensuring all values used in calculations are appropriate types
   - Providing sensible defaults when values are missing

3. **Enhanced Context Collection**:
   - More detailed debugging information
   - Better traceability of issues

## Verification
The fix has been applied and the server restarted. You should now be able to access:
https://aksjeradar.trade/portfolio/

Without encountering any error messages.

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a monitoring system for the stock data services to track reliability
2. Add more robust caching to reduce dependence on external APIs
3. Implement a background job to periodically verify and repair any corrupted portfolio data
