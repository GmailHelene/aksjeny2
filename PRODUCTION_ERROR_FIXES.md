# Production Error Fixes Plan

Based on production logs, I need to fix the following issues:

## 1. AI Analysis Error: 'list object' has no attribute 'items'
- Location: analysis.py AI route
- Issue: The AI analysis function is returning a list instead of dict for economic_indicators

## 2. Screener Error: 'available_filters' is undefined  
- Location: analysis.py screener route
- Issue: available_filters variable not defined in current analysis.py

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Error: 'float' object is not subscriptable
- Location: analysis.py sentiment route  
- Issue: Trying to subscript a float value in sentiment data

## 4. CSRF Token Errors
- Location: Multiple forms
- Issue: Missing CSRF protection on forms

## 5. Missing Stock Data for WILS.OL
- Location: stocks.py
- Issue: No fallback data for unknown tickers

Let me fix each issue systematically.
