- Remove conflicting @main.route('/search') that was intercepting stocks blueprint
- Verify @demo_access decorators on stocks.search and stocks.compare routes  
- Ensure both endpoints are in public_endpoints whitelist
- Fix route conflicts that prevented proper blueprint resolution

Fixes:
- https://aksjeradar.trade/stocks/search?q=tesla now works properly
- https://aksjeradar.trade/stocks/compare shows actual interface
- Both endpoints accessible without demo restrictions"
