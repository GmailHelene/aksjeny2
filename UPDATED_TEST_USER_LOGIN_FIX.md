# Updated Test User Login Fix

## Problem
The test users (`test@aksjeradar.trade` and `investor@aksjeradar.trade`) are in the exempt users list but cannot log in with the error "Invalid username or password".

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code and database, we found several potential issues:

1. **User record issues**: The user records might not exist or might have incorrect password hashes
2. **Authentication implementation**: The login function looks for users by email and verifies password hashes using `check_password_hash`
3. **Database schema inconsistencies**: There might be issues with missing columns or database schema evolution

## Solutions Implemented

We've created multiple scripts to fix this issue, taking different approaches:

### 1. Direct SQLite Fix (Recommended)

The `clean_test_users.py` script directly updates the SQLite database by:
- Checking if users exist and updating them if they do
- Creating new users with the correct credentials if they don't
- Setting appropriate subscription and admin status

This approach bypasses SQLAlchemy and Flask to avoid any schema or model issues.

### 2. Complete Record Recreation

The `fixed_user_login.py` script takes a more thorough approach by:
- Deleting existing user records (if any) to avoid conflicts
- Creating new records from scratch with all necessary fields
- Validating that passwords are properly hashed and stored
- Verifying user creation was successful

### 3. One-Step Quick Fix

The `one_step_fix.py` provides a simpler approach that:
- Updates user records directly in the database
- Sets required fields to ensure proper login
- Provides detailed logging of the operations

## How to Fix

1. Stop any running Flask server
2. Run one of the fix scripts (recommended: `python clean_test_users.py`)
3. Restart the Flask server with `python main.py`
4. Try logging in with these credentials:
   - Email: `test@aksjeradar.trade` / Password: `aksjeradar2024`
   - Email: `investor@aksjeradar.trade` / Password: `aksjeradar2024`

## Additional Troubleshooting

If login still fails after running the fix script and restarting the server, try:

1. **Check the database directly**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 app.db
   SELECT id, email, username, password_hash FROM users WHERE email IN ('test@aksjeradar.trade', 'investor@aksjeradar.trade');
   ```

2. **Try manually creating a user** from a Python shell:
   ```python
   from app import create_app
   from app.models.user import User
   from app.extensions import db
   
   app = create_app()
   with app.app_context():
       user = User(username='testuser', email='test@aksjeradar.trade')
       user.set_password('aksjeradar2024')
       user.has_subscription = True
       user.subscription_type = 'lifetime'
       user.is_admin = True
       db.session.add(user)
       db.session.commit()
   ```

3. **Check authentication implementation**:
   - The login route is in `app/auth.py`
   - The user model is in `app/models/user.py`
   - Authentication is handled by the `check_password` method in the User class

4. **Examine application logs** for any errors during login attempts

## Why This Works

The key is ensuring that the user records exist in the database and have correctly hashed passwords. Both `test@aksjeradar.trade` and `investor@aksjeradar.trade` need to:

1. Have records in the `users` table
2. Have proper password hashes generated with `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash`
3. Be configured with the correct subscription status

Our fix scripts ensure all of these conditions are met, allowing the login process to successfully authenticate these users.

## Mimicking Working Account Logic

As you noted, `helene721@gmail.com` logs in successfully. Our approach is essentially copying the same pattern:

1. We're creating the test users with the same field values
2. Using the same password hashing mechanism
3. Setting up the same subscription and admin status

The fixes ensure that both test accounts follow the same database structure and authentication logic as the working account.
