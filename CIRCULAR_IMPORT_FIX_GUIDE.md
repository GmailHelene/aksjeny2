# Fixing Circular Import Error in Flask App

## Problem

You encountered the following error when starting your Flask application:

```
ERROR during Flask app startup: cannot import name 'app' from 'app' (/app/app/__init__.py)
```

This is a circular import issue that happens because:

1. Your main module is named `app.py`
2. You also have a package named `app` (the folder with `__init__.py`)
3. The line `from app import create_app` in your `app.py` file creates a circular reference

## Solution

We've fixed this issue by modifying the imports in two key files:

### 1. app.py

Changed:
```python
from app import create_app
```

To:
```python
from app.__init__ import create_app
```

### 2. wsgi.py

Changed:
```python
from app import create_app
```

To:
```python
from app.__init__ import create_app
```

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Run the fix script

We've created two scripts that will apply the necessary changes:

- For Windows: Run `fix_circular_imports.bat`
- For Linux/Mac: Run `fix_circular_imports.sh` (make it executable first with `chmod +x fix_circular_imports.sh`)

### Option 2: Manual changes

1. Modify `app.py` to use `from app.__init__ import create_app`
2. Modify `wsgi.py` to use `from app.__init__ import create_app`
3. Deploy your application

### Verify the fix

Run the `verify_imports.py` script to check if the circular import issue is resolved:

```
python verify_imports.py
```

## Best Practices to Avoid Circular Imports

1. Don't name your entry point the same as your package (e.g., don't use `app.py` as your entry point when you have an `app/` package)
2. Use relative imports within packages
3. Consider restructuring your application to have a clearer separation of concerns
4. Use explicit imports (`from package.module import symbol`) rather than namespace imports (`import package.module`)

## Next Steps

Once the fix is applied, you should be able to deploy your application without the circular import error. If you encounter any other issues, please provide the error message for further assistance.
