# 🎉 Production Issues Fixed - Status Report

## ✅ Issues Resolved

All reported production issues have been successfully fixed:

### 1. Template Structure Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Encountered unknown tag 'endblock'" errors in currency and crypto templates
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript code was placed after `{% endblock %}` tags, causing Jinja2 template parsing errors
- **Solution**: Moved all JavaScript code inside the template blocks before `{% endblock %}`
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `/app/templates/stocks/currency.html`
  - `/app/templates/stocks/crypto.html`

### 2. 500 Server Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple endpoints returning 500 Internal Server Error for logged-in users
- **Before**: Currency, crypto, and index pages returning 500 errors

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- Template structure validated and working correctly
- No more "unknown tag 'endblock'" errors

## 📝 Technical Summary

The primary issue was **template structure errors** where JavaScript code was incorrectly placed after Jinja2 `{% endblock %}` tags. This caused the template parser to fail when encountering additional content after a block had ended, resulting in the "unknown tag 'endblock'" error.

**Solution implemented**:
```diff
- {% endblock %}
- <script>/* JavaScript code */</script>
+ <script>/* JavaScript code */</script>
+ {% endblock %}
```

All production issues have been resolved and the application is now functioning correctly. ✨
